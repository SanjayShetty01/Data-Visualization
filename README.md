# Data Visualization
<br />
The main purposes of this repo are, <br />
1. to motivate me to do one visualization per week <br />
2. To share the same online. <br />
<br />
I'm doing this because visualization has always been my Achilles heel. Hence I would also welcome critical feedback on the visualization. <br />

`R` folder contains all the codes in R. <br />
`fig` folder contains all the picture in `png` format <br />
