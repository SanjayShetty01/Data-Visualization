# Data Visualization

The main purposes of this repo are,

- to motivate me to do one visualization per week 
- To share the same online. 

I'm doing this because visualization has always been my Achilles heel. Hence I would also welcome critical feedback on the visualization. 

`R` folder contains all the codes in R.

`fig` folder contains all the picture in `png` format
